Investigating the Relationship between Stress and Sleep Using Machine Learning
This project focuses on exploring the relationship between stress and sleep patterns using machine learning techniques. While the connection between stress and sleep may seem obvious, delving into this relationship provides an opportunity to gain new insights and perspectives. By leveraging machine learning algorithms and analyzing data from various sources, including wearable devices and surveys, we aim to uncover hidden patterns and understand the nuances of how stress affects sleep and vice versa. Our research seeks to contribute to a deeper understanding of stress and sleep dynamics, offering potential implications for stress management and sleep improvement strategies.
